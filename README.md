## About

This is a replication package for 'Child Protective Services Contact in the 20 Most Populous Counties in the US'. This package contains all data and code needed to reproduce figures and tables ni the report. It does not contain underlying individual-level data on child welfare system contact. These data (AFCARS; NCANDS) are available upon request from the National Data Archive on Child Abuse and Neglect.

County event count data are derived from multiply imputed data on child race/ethnicity using the methods from the R package `mice`. This code is available in the repository f-edwards/cps_lifetables/states

All questions and comments can be directed to frank.edwards (at) rutgers.edu
